Contact Tracing - Belgium

![](apkicon_BE.png)

**CORONALERT** was commissioned by Sciensano, the Interfederal Committee for Testing & Tracing and the entities responsible for contact tracing in Brussels, the German-speaking Community, Flanders and Wallonia.

The technical development was carried out by the Belgian companies DevSide and Ixor.

It's a decentralized solution that relies on GAEN - Apple+Google Exposure Notifications API Framework. App & Backend are mainly based on German CORONA WARN app's code.
