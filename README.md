Contact Tracing - Belgium

![](apkicon_BE.png)

**CORONALERT** was commissioned by Sciensano, the Interfederal Committee for Testing & Tracing and the entities responsible for contact tracing in Brussels, the German-speaking Community, Flanders and Wallonia.

The technical development was carried out by the Belgian companies DevSide and Ixor.

It's a decentralized solution that relies on GAEN - Apple+Google Exposure Notifications API Framework. App & Backend are mainly based on German CORONA WARN app's code.

**Notice :** *even though a version of the app is available also on Huawei AppGallery, such listing isn't included among the official download sources* . *App version on AppGallery is several builds behind PlayStore release* . 

*AppGallery version is based indeed on the same code of 1.6.0 Play Store build*. *Therefore it's also useless to those users who own Honor/Huawei GMS uncertified devices = it doesn't support HMS ContactShield API* .
